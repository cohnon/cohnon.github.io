<p><strong>Creativity</strong> isn't something we see on the mainstream internet anymore. Whether
it's the bright pulsing colours that clashed against one another, or the wonky
layouts pulling your attention in all their uncoordinated, chaotic glory. The old web
was full of personality. Every page was a handcrafted window into someone's brain.
When you visited someone's site, you didn't just use it. You experienced it.</p>

<p>Now, what was once the wild west of virtual human interaction, has become this
sterile pot of a dozen-or-so sites which all seem to have decided that flat,
advertiser-optimised feeds, and dull minimalistic sameness, was the way to
go. Sure, you're given some means of expressing yourself. But only within their
tight boundaries. Instead, you're encouraged to <em>consume</em>. It wasn't that long
ago when this change happened, and it makes me sad that entire generations are
going to miss that freedom. Entire generations thinking what we have now
suffices.</p>
<p>Have you seen the content people (and especially kids) are watching nowadays?
An endless conveyor of TTS misinformational slop being pushed onto our screens
almost as fast as it leaves our brains.</p>
<p>There's this thing called the <strong>dead internet theory</strong> which honestly isn't much
of a theory anymore. It's the idea that AI-generated content has surpassed our own
human made internet [1]. That most of what you see online was not made by
another person, but by 1's and 0's on a machine. Despite the massive growth of the
internet in this new digital age, it's never felt so empty.</p>
<p>But out on the margins of this desolate series of tubes we call the internet,
people have been building things for fun again. Not for clicks. Nor monetary
insentive. But for themselves.</p>
<p>This is the indie web.</p>
