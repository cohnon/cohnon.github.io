**Creativity** isn't something we see on the mainstream internet anymore. Whether
it's the bright pulsing colours that clashed against one another, or the wonky
layouts pulling your attention in all their uncoordinated, chaotic glory. The old web
was full of personality. Every page was a handcrafted window into someone's brain.
When you visited someone's site, you didn't just use it. You experienced it.

##### this was YouTube ?!

Now, what was once the wild west of virtual human interaction, has become this
sterile pot of a dozen-or-so sites which all seem to have decided that flat,
advertiser-optimised feeds, and dull minimalistic sameness, was the way to
go. Sure, you're given some means of expressing yourself. But only within their
tight boundaries. Instead, you're encouraged to *consume*. It wasn't that long
ago when this change happened, and it makes me sad that entire generations are
going to miss that freedom. Entire generations thinking what we have now
suffices.
